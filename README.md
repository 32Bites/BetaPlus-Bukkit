# BetaPlus-Bukkit
Bukkit port of Beta+

This is the Github Repo for my Spigot/Bukkit port of Beta+, found at

[Beta+ Repo](https://github.com/mrburger/Beta-Plus)

I aim to keep this plugin updated as **frequently** as possible, but I do not guarantee this plugin will have the same update schedule
as Beta+ Forge. Additionally, there may be some features that will never come to the Bukkit version, like custom resources.
